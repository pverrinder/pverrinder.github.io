# Reading List
List of books I have read, am currently reading, or plan to read. I only started keeping track at the end of 2023 and I'm not going to try to rememeber everything I read before that. My goal for 2025 and beyond is to average about one book per month. 

## 2025
- [ ] *The Idiot*, Fyodor Dostoevsky

## 2024
- [x] *The Four Loves*, C.S. Lewis
- [x] *1984*, George Orwell
- [x] *John Adams*, David McCullough


## 2023
- [x] *Benjamin Franklin*, Walter Isaacson
- I don't remember others. Maybe none because I had a kid, finished my PhD, and moved across the world.
